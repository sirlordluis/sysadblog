	<p>
		Hello, my name is Luis Alberto, I'm software developer and this is my WebSite.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I like to watch animes/web series, listen to music (and very early stage of learning guitar), 
		read and explore new stuff in tech and try out new technologies to build fun side projects, 
		and spend time with friends and family.
	</p>

	<p>
		I write about awesome or useful technical stuff I encounter. Also I'll share lots of useful tips. 
		This is static blog generated by bunch of Regexes hosted on GitHub pages for free, because I have strong belief that thats how blogs should function.
